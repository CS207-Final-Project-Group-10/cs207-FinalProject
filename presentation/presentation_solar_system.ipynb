    "# Simulating Planetary Orbits with a Symplectic Integrator\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of this library in Fluxions in homage to Isaac Newton, whose early name for differential calculus was \"the method of fluxions.\"  (For an entertaining work of  fiction that places the invention of calculus in historical context, I highly recommend Neal Stephenson's Baroque Cycle.)  The problem Newton was trying to solve was calculating the motion of the planets around the sun under the influence of gravity.  He succeeded in calculating a highly accuracte approximation based on all the planets moving around the sun in elliptical orbits.  This approximation effectively treats the sun as a very heavy stationary body and all the planets orbit around it.  It ignores the gravitational forces between planets and any movement of the sun itself.  It's a good approximation because the sun is much heavier than the planets put toghether (approximately 99.8% of the of the mass of the solar system), but it's not perfect because Jupiter in particular is heavy enough to throw things off.\n",

    "## Numerical Solution of Differential Equations with Symplectic Integrators\n",
    "How do scientists and engineers today compute planetary orbits to the highest standards of precision suitable for launching space vehicles?  They use numerical integrators to solve the Newton's equations of motion.  In particular, they use a special class of numerical integrators called **symplectic integrators**.  Most students in STEM fields who encounter differential equations are likely to see a very unrepresentative sample of ones that are analytically tractable, such as a simple harmonic oscillator.  It turns out that most differential equations of interest do **not** have analytical solutions, but have to be solved numerically instead.  This is a mature field of study in applied mathematics, and many methods exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple numerical method is the highly intuitive Forward Euler Method, in which the equation is discretized in time:\n",

    "\n",
    "Citation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method#/media/File:Euler_method.svg\n",
    "\n",
    "As the picture suggests, discretization errors can gradually accumulate and the approximated trajectory can drift away from the true solution.  These errors can be mitigated by using higher order methods with small step size, but unless an integrator is carefully constructed, it is likely to have a drift where it either gains or loses energy as the system evolves.  This destroys its ability to make accurate calculations over a large number of steps."
